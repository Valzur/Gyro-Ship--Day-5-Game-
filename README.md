# Day 5 game

Just like the name Implies, this game was a part of my 5 day challenge of A game a day,
In this game, i was experimenting with gyroscope movement, so the game is more like a ball trying to stabilize on a table.


## Installation

For this one, you might wanna download and compile the game for yourself,
or just use the source code :"D
